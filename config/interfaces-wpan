# This configuration file fragment is required to allow ifupdown to
# automatically bring up the monitor (wpan0) and 6LoWPAN (lowpan0)
# interfaces for an IEEE 802.15.4 PHY.
#
# Note that the "wpan0" monitor interface does not actually support
# the "inet" or "inet6" address families; the "iface wpan0" line
# exists solely to ensure that ifupdown will bring up the interface.
# All IP traffic is carried via the "lowpan0" interface.
